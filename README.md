# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Our goal is to analyze passenger data and develop predictive models to determine factors influencing survival.

## Project Structure
1. data: Contains datasets used for training and testing the predictive models.
2. notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. src: Source code for machine learning models and utility functions.
4. README.md: Overview of the project, including objectives, methodologies, and results.
   
## Methodologies
1. Data Collection: Gathered passenger information including age, sex, ticket class, and survival status.
2. Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features.
3. Feature Engineering: Created new features such as family size and title from passenger names.
4. Model Selection: Explored various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
5. Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
   
## Results
1. Achieved high accuracy in predicting Titanic passenger survival.
2. Identified key factors influencing survival, such as passenger class and gender.
3. Provided insights into historical events and passenger demographics.
   
## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Future Work
1. Fine-tune model hyperparameters for improved performance.
2. Explore ensemble learning techniques for further enhancing predictive capabilities.
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess model robustness.
